### TODO List 
- Figure out the purpose for our discord bot e.g. (provide DnD features to us)
    - Discuss features e.g. (search spells)
- Create our journey map (String of stories[units of work] that get us to the finish line)
- Define our working agreement (How we work together, do we want to swarm, peer program, solo silo, code review, etc)
- Decide upon name for the bot
